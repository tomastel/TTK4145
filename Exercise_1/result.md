When running the two threads with a shared variable, they will both access the variable. Incrementing/decrementing a variable is done in multiple steps. For instance the incrementing function will firstly read the value, increment the value and write the value. In the middle of this the decrementing function might start its process. This can lead to strange results due to misreading/miswriting of the value, as we got in the test. This problem is known as race condition.
