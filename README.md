# [TTK4145: Real Time Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4145/#tab=omEmnet)

*Project in collaboration with [Khuong Huynh](https://github.com/Khuongh) and [Maiken Pedersen](https://github.com/maikenpedersen).*


This repository contains all files of our result for the elevator project in the course [TTK4145 Real Time Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4145/#tab=omEmnet) taught at NTNU. The course is taught as part of the master's programme [Cybernetics and Robotics](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mttk).

The elevator project aims to teach the students about software design, real-time and distributed systems through designing and writing a distributed program for an elevator systems consisting of n elevators and m floors. The students are free to decide how they wish to design the system, including distributed system type (most students choose P2P or master-slave), communication protocols (TCP, UDP, both or other) and programming language.

Feel free to read the [project requirements](https://github.com/tomastel/TTK4145/blob/main/Elevator%20project/Project%20requirements.md) for more detailed functionality.
